 * policy, not shared UI, exactly as ROLE_SIGNUP_CONFIG is.
 *
 * Content is data rather than markup so a document can be rendered, linked to
 * by clause, and version-compared without a component knowing what a buyer is.
 * Adding the agent agreement is one data file and one registry entry.

 * React. That is what keeps a document portable: the same object can be
 * rendered to a page, and later to an email or a PDF, with no rewrite.
