 * The customer Terms and Conditions, version 1.0.

 * Data, not markup, so the same object serves the page, the consent record
 * written at signup, and anything later that needs the text without a browser.
 *
 * Two rules govern edits here.
 *
 * A revision that changes an obligation must raise `version`. Signup stores
 * this string against the account, so leaving it alone would make the record
 * claim the customer agreed to text they never saw.
 *
 * No naira figure appears anywhere in this document, and none may be added.
 * Clause 10.8 says the rescheduling fee equals the delivery fee in effect at
 * the time, which is a reference rather than a number, and every other money
 * rule is written the same way. A figure typed here is a second copy of a rate
 * that lives in packages/pricing, and it will drift from what is charged.
