/*
 * The agent agreement, version 0.1, PLACEHOLDER.
 *
 * This text has not been through the review the customer terms had. It exists
 * so the agent signup can link to a real document and record a real consent
 * rather than collect a tick that refers to nothing, and it is deliberately
 * conservative: it states the relationship and the obligations that are already
 * true in the product, and promises nothing about money.
 *
 * Before agent recruitment opens, replace the sections below with the reviewed
 * agreement and raise `version` to "1.0". Raising the version is what makes
 * every consent recorded against 0.1 identifiable as consent to the draft.
 *
 * The commission basis is deliberately absent. The locked decision is a flat
 * naira amount per package banded by product, the code still runs a percentage,
 * and the two disagree. A rate written into an agent agreement cannot be
 * lowered afterwards, so it stays out until that is settled.
 *
 * No naira figure belongs in this file, for the same reason as the customer
 * terms: every rate lives in packages/pricing and is referenced, never copied.
