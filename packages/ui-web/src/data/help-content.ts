    category: "ordering",
    question: "How do I place an order?",
    answer:
      "Open Shop from the sidebar, add what you need to your cart, then go to Checkout. Enter your state, LGA and delivery zone along with your address, choose Today or Tomorrow for delivery, then pay with your card or your Debridgers wallet. Your order is confirmed as soon as the payment goes through.",
  },
  {
    category: "ordering",
    question: "Do I have to pay before my order is confirmed?",
    answer:
      "Yes. When you check out, your order is created with a Pending status and nothing is dispatched yet. It only moves to Paid once your card or wallet payment succeeds. We do not deliver against unpaid orders.",
  },
  {
    category: "ordering",
    question: "How is the delivery fee calculated?",
    answer:
      "The fee is based on the delivery zone you select and the items in your cart. It is quoted live at checkout as soon as you pick your zone, and the full total is shown in the summary before you pay. Nothing is added afterwards.",
  },
  {
    category: "ordering",
    question: "Can I leave instructions for the rider?",
    answer:
      "Yes. There is a Delivery Note field at checkout. Use it for landmarks, gate numbers, or a time that suits you best.",
  },
  {
    category: "ordering",
    question: "How do I quickly reorder something I bought before?",
    answer:
      "Open Shop from the sidebar. If you have ordered before, a Buy Again section appears at the top with the items you bought most recently, so you can add them straight to your cart.",
  },
  {
    category: "payments",
    question: "What payment methods can I use?",
    answer:
      "Two: your debit or credit card, processed securely by Paystack, or your Debridgers wallet balance. We do not currently offer cash on delivery or manual bank transfer, so please do not hand cash to a rider.",
  },
  {
    category: "payments",
    question: "How do I pay with my wallet?",
    answer:
      "Choose Wallet at the checkout payment step. The order total is deducted from your available balance immediately and the order is marked Paid. You need enough available balance to cover the whole total.",
  },
  {
    category: "payments",
    question: "How do I add money to my wallet?",
    answer:
      "Go to Wallet in the sidebar and tap Add Funds. Enter the amount and you will be taken to Paystack to pay. Your balance updates as soon as the payment is confirmed.",
  },
  {
    category: "payments",
    question: "What if my wallet balance is not enough at checkout?",
    answer:
      "Checkout will tell you how much you have and how much is needed. Either top up in the Wallet section first, or switch the payment method to card and pay the difference that way.",
  },
  {
    category: "payments",
    question: "Are my card details safe?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Card payments happen on Paystack's own secure page, not on ours. Debridgers never sees or stores your card number, CVV or PIN.",
  },
  {
    category: "payments",
    question: "My card payment failed, or I closed the payment page. What now?",
    answer:
      "Nothing is taken from your account and your order simply stays Pending and unpaid. You can go back to checkout and try again. Orders that stay unpaid are cancelled automatically so they do not sit on your list.",
  },
  {
    category: "payments",
    question: "I was debited but my order still shows Pending.",
    answer:
      "Confirmation from Paystack occasionally arrives a little after the debit. Refresh My Orders in a few minutes and it should move to Paid. If it has not updated shortly after, contact support with your order number and we will trace the payment.",
  },
  {
    category: "delivery",
    question: "When will my order arrive?",
    answer:
      "You choose the window at checkout. Today is for orders placed before 12pm. Tomorrow is delivered between 9am and 5pm. You can follow the exact status at any time from My Orders.",
  },
  {
    category: "delivery",
    question: "Which areas do you deliver to?",
    answer:
      "We deliver across Kaduna by delivery zone. At checkout, pick your state and LGA and the zones we serve in that area will appear. If no zone shows up for your LGA, we do not cover it yet.",
  },
  {
    category: "delivery",
    question: "How do I track my order?",
    answer:
      "Go to My Orders in the sidebar. Use the tabs to filter by All, Active, Pending, Confirmed or Cancelled, and tap any order to see its full details.",
  },
  {
    category: "delivery",
    question: "Can I change my delivery address after ordering?",
    answer:
      "There is no self-service way to edit an address once the order is placed. Contact support as soon as you can with your order number and the correct address. We can only change it before the order goes out for delivery.",
  },
  {
    category: "delivery",
    question: "Do I have to be there to receive the delivery?",
    answer:
      "Someone needs to be available at the address to receive the items and confirm the delivery. If a neighbour or security post should take it instead, say so in the Delivery Note at checkout.",
  },
  {
    category: "problems",
    question: "What do the order statuses mean?",
    answer:
      "Pending means the order exists but has not been paid for yet. Paid means your payment is confirmed and we are preparing it. On the way means it has been dispatched. Delivered means it reached you. Cancelled means the order was stopped, either by you or because it was never paid for.",
  },
  {
    category: "problems",
    question: "Can I cancel my order?",
    answer:
      "You can cancel while the order is still Pending, meaning before it has been paid for. Open the order in My Orders, tap Cancel order and give a short reason. Once an order is paid it can no longer be cancelled from the app, so contact support to ask for a refund instead.",
  },
  {
    category: "problems",
    question: "How do refunds work?",
    answer:
      "Approved refunds are credited back to your Debridgers wallet rather than your bank account. The balance is available immediately and you can spend it on your next order.",
  },
  {
    category: "problems",
    question: "I received the wrong item, or something is missing.",
    answer:
      "Contact support the same day with your order number and a clear photo of what you received. Getting in touch before the rider leaves makes it much easier to fix on the spot.",
  },
  {
    category: "problems",
    question: "My items arrived damaged or spoiled.",
    answer:
      "Take a photo before you put anything away, then contact support with your order number. If you can, check the items while the rider is still there so the problem can be confirmed straight away.",
  },
  {
    category: "account",
    question: "How do I log in?",
    answer:
      "With the email address and password you registered with. Logging in with a phone number is not supported, so use your email even if we also have your number on file.",
  },
  {
    category: "account",
    question: "How do I change my name, phone number or password?",
    answer:
      "Go to Settings in the sidebar. You can update your name and phone number there, and there is a separate section for changing your password. Your email address cannot be changed from the app.",
  },
  {
    category: "account",
    question: "Can I turn order notifications on or off?",
    answer:
      "Yes. In Settings you can switch email and SMS notifications on or off independently. Your order history is always available in My Orders regardless of those settings.",
